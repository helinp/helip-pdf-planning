$entry = $pdfPlanning->createEntry()
                     ->setDay('Monday')
                     ->setTime('08:00 - 10:00')
                     ->setLocation('Room 101')
                     ->setActivity('Meeting with Team')
                     ->setInstructor('John Doe');

// Configure the schedule
$pdfPlanning->setTitle('My Weekly Schedule')
            ->addEntries(...$entries)  // Add entries dynamically
            .build();

// Save the generated PDF to a file
